**Progress Doc**
Following MVVM Architectural Model
1. Building UI View — In Prog ~ 75% there 📋
   - ✅ Added Community suggestion - better back & forward filetree navigation
   - ✅ Basic model respects security exclusions model better
   - 💬 Needs gallery view and recursive toggle viewmodel to function

3. Connecting View Model/Controllers — In Prog ⌨️ 💬
   - Center Column: System File Treeview - can view any storage drive connected with permission (usb, cloud, local)
   - Pending: Left side
        - Sys/Mon to update center column view
        - + Buttons to add mon/workspace
        - Workspaces list to be scrollable - to update with real list from json
        - Add hover options - like remove workspace / remove mon folder
   - Pending: update center with system file treeview as default vs loaded monitored folders list view
   - Pending: update right view with file type thumbnails recursively
        - include filepath, search, filters, etc. there

5. Link Models/JSON/Settings/Data/Backend/Security Protocols — TBD
